# My Personal Project

## Background
This program is a customer tracking system where customers can create a customized order. The store offers four items that can be customized: sweaters, shirts, tote bags, and goodies. Customers can add letters and pictures onto these items. Customers will be able to add items to their cart and place orders. To place an order, customers will have to input their name, address, phone number, and select whether they would like it delivered or picked up. Once it is ordered, customers can track their order status. The order status will be either: preparing your items, out for delivery, delivered. Once it has been delivered, customers can rate their experiences and leave a review.
I have chosen this idea for my personal project because I have an interest in business and I feel that I would learn a lot from trying to create this customer tracking system.
