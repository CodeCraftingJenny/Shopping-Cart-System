# My Personal Project

## Background

This program is a shopping cart system where customers can create an order. The store offers four items
that can be customized: beanies, caps, tote bags, and hoodies. Customers will be able to add items to 
their cart and place orders. To place an order, customers will have to  input their name, address, phone 
number. I have chosen this idea for my  personal project because I have an interest in business and I
feel that I would learn a  lot from trying to create this.

to browse hoodies, you can do that by pressing the "Hoodie" button to see what sizes and colours are available. 
- You can choose the size and colour by selecting an option from the drop-down menu after you have clicked into an item. 
- You can order multiple items by clicking on the cart button, then by pressing on the order button.
- You can add items to the cart pressing into the clothing option and pressing add cart after you have chosen your 
preferred colour and size. 
- You can remove items by inputting the index of the item that you want removed. For example, if there are 2 items in 
your cart, and you want to remove the second item, you can input 2 into the field and press remove.

- To save what you have in your cart click on the save option in the cart menu
- To load what you had previously in cart, click on the load button.
- You can locate my visual component when you first run the program. There are pictures of clothing, and if you want to
view different colours, you can choose a colour, and it will show what the item looks like in that colour.
