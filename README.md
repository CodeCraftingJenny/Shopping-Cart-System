# My Personal Project

## Background

This program is a shopping cart system where customers can create an order. The store offers four items
that can be customized: beanies, caps, tote bags, and hoodies. Customers will be able to add items to 
their cart and place orders. To place an order, customers will have to  input their name, address, phone 
number. I have chosen this idea for my  personal project because I have an interest in business and I
feel that I would learn a  lot from trying to create this.
